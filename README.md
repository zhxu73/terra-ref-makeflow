# terra-ref-makeflow

As of cctools 7.0.21, the support for the sub-workflow feature in JX is unclear, you need to pull the current master branch from cctools github repo and compile from source.


* Those commands will compile and install cctools to your home directory, `makeflow` will be at `$HOME/cctools/bin/makeflow`, which is the path that `entrypoint.sh` uses.
```bash
git clone git://github.com/cooperative-computing-lab/cctools.git cctools-github-src
cd cctools-github-src
./configure --prefix $HOME/cctools
make
make install
```

* Run the workflow, `-r 0` for 0 retry attempts if failed
```bash
chmod 755 entrypoint.sh
./entrypoint.sh -r 0
```

* Clean up output and logs
```bash
./entrypoint.sh -c
rm -f makeflow.jx.args.*
```
* Modify `main_env.jx` to run on other data sets
Just append/change the full iRODS path in the `IRODS_DIR_PATH_LIST` array (path needs to be in double quotes)

And append/change the UUID (part of the filename, e.g `5716a146-8d3d-4d80-99b9-6cbf95cfedfb_left.bin` has a UUID of `5716a146-8d3d-4d80-99b9-6cbf95cfedfb`) in the `UUID_LIST` array

`NUM_SET` is the number of data sets, basically the number of elements in the `IRODS_DIR_PATH_LIST` array

> Note: the elements in the `IRODS_DIR_PATH_LIST` array and `UUID_LIST` array needs to be 1-to-1 corresponded, meaning data file with `UUID` of 0th elements in `UUID_LIST` are stored at the path represented by the 0th element in the `IRODS_DIR_PATH_LIST` array
